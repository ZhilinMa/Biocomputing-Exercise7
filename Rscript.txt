#Part 1: iris.csv -> iris.txt conversion
#creates a data frame from the csv
df <- read.csv("iris.csv")

#writes the data frame to a table with a tab as separator
write.table(df, file = "iris.txt", sep = "\t")


#PART 2
#I am creating all of the list elements before making the list

#1) a vector with length 10 containing 100, 200, . . . , 1000
a <- seq(from = 100, to = 1000, by = 100)

#2) a two-row, two-column data frame with the team names and
#final score from last weekâ€™s Notre Dame football game
b <- data.frame(UNLV = 21, ND = 44)

#3) the number 999
c <- 999

#4) a 10-row 5-column matrix containing integers from 1 to 50
d <- matrix(1L:50L, nrow = 10, ncol = 5)

#5) a vector containing three letters 
e <- c("g", "i", "t")

#and the list containing all of these elements
final <- list(a, b, c, d, e)
